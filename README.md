# Project Overview:

## Create parallax wallpapers for Lively Wallpaper from a single image:
This program is meant to separate the layers of an image and turn it into a parallax interactive wallpaper made with html/css/js. This wallpaper can be used for any wallpaper app that uses wallpaper made with these tools, but was specifically made with Lively Wallpaper in mind.

## Previews:
Here are some album covers turned into wallpapers and the settings used to accomplish that result:
